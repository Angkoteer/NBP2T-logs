  <summary><h2>v1.2.1 Changelog (10/10/23) [Diskon 10.10]</h2></summary>

  <summary><h3>Full changelog</h3></summary>

  #### Resurrected a lost media!
  I'm not exaggerating when I say that this was the hardest one to find.  
  It took me about 8 months to find before this song resurfaced in the web archive.  
  Anyways, probably will reupload on my channel (or not, because the last time I've seen this song, it was being copystriked)  

  Oh. Yeah. Forgot to tell you. It's **Care Bebek** from **DJ ERKA**.

  #### New songs
  - **Added DJ Corona** (this is peak humor according to Indonesians in 2023)
  - **Added DJ Campina** by **DJ Wahyu RMX**
  - **Added Pantun Janda** by **Muqadam** (this wasn't a DJ song but I figured it was enough of a banger that I need to include this here)
  - **Added Ikan Dalam Kolam** by **Muqadam** (same reason as above)
  - **Added DJ Bernyanyi** by **Ramuji Akmal Sadega**
  - **Added DJ Die For You** by **Raymondphilipus** (turns out not as bad as I thought)
  - **Added DJ Skibidi Bom**, this time from **Hendy Adji**
  - **Added DJ Paket Ashiap** by **Jay Stefan**
  - **Added DJ Japanese Goblin x Jedag Jedug Preman** by **Afrian AF** (I swear I hate this song so much)
  - **Added Move Your Body x Pak Cepak Jeder** by **Unyil 12 Remix**
  - **Added Bila Tiba (Funkot Remix)** by **Adhyarta Funkot**

  #### Re-added removed songs
  - Re-added **DJ Untuk Pengisi Hatiku** by the original remixer, **DJ Komang Rimex**
  - Re-added **DJ Chica Loca** by **Zein Fvnky**
  - Re-added **Jedag Jedug Preman** by **Afrian AF** because for some reason the old one got taken down

    you guys are helping me a huge lot over this playlist. Thank you again.

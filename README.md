<details>
  <summary><h3>Full changelog</h3></summary>

  #### Resurrected a lost media!
  I'm not exaggerating when I say that this was the hardest one to find.  
  It took me about 8 months to find before this song resurfaced in the web archive.  
  Anyways, probably will reupload on my channel (or not, because the last time I've seen this song, it was being copystriked)  

  Oh. Yeah. Forgot to tell you. It's **Care Bebek** from **DJ ERKA**.

  #### New songs
  - **Added DJ Corona** (this is peak humor according to Indonesians in 2023)
  - **Added DJ Campina** by **DJ Wahyu RMX**
  - **Added Pantun Janda** by **Muqadam** (this wasn't a DJ song but I figured it was enough of a banger that I need to include this here)
  - **Added Ikan Dalam Kolam** by **Muqadam** (same reason as above)
  - **Added DJ Bernyanyi** by **Ramuji Akmal Sadega**
  - **Added DJ Die For You** by **Raymondphilipus** (turns out not as bad as I thought)
  - **Added DJ Skibidi Bom**, this time from **Hendy Adji**
  - **Added DJ Paket Ashiap** by **Jay Stefan**
  - **Added DJ Japanese Goblin x Jedag Jedug Preman** by **Afrian AF** (I swear I hate this song so much)
  - **Added Move Your Body x Pak Cepak Jeder** by **Unyil 12 Remix**
  - **Added Bila Tiba (Funkot Remix)** by **Adhyarta Funkot**

  #### Re-added removed songs
  - Re-added **DJ Untuk Pengisi Hatiku** by the original remixer, **DJ Komang Rimex**
  - Re-added **DJ Chica Loca** by **Zein Fvnky**
  - Re-added **Jedag Jedug Preman** by **Afrian AF** because for some reason the old one got taken down

  <summary><h2>v1.3 Changelog (15/10/23) [Archivist's Haven, Pt. 2]</h2></summary>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>

  - **Archive.org backups!** Peep it over [here](https://archive.org/details/NBP2T)
  - **Added correct metadatas for the Google Drive backup** (and subsequently Archive.org)
  - **Revamped and added some songs following the addition of correct metadata** including 1 lost media restored out of my curiosity

<details>
  <summary><h3>Full changelog</h3></summary>
  
  #### Archive.org backup
  Let's hope this one stays up forever. I really don't want to leave these songs unattended with my GDrive because Google could do anything if they wanted to.  
  Better safe than sorry, right? Anyways this would probably be updated every few weeks or months.  
  I don't have the time to attend it everytime I download new songs.  
  [Always free to download, of course](https://archive.org/details/NBP2T)

  #### Correct metadatas(!)
  Sorry for neglecting this for the longest time.  
  Pretty dumb to think that I can rename filenames but can't change the filename into metadata tags.
  Anyways, updates already pushed to the Google Drive and Archive.org backups (sadly not available for YouTube but oh well)

  #### Revamped and replaced songs
  - Replaced **DJ Untuk Pengisi Hatiku x Mama Muda** with the original one. Turns out it was called **Ku Tak Akan Bersuara x Mama Muda**. My bad.
  - Added the original **DJ De Ra Go** (which was made by **Noka AxL**) without removing the sped up one.
  - Replaced **DJ Hei Apa Apa x Tak Tak Tik Tik** by **Donny Fernanda** (sorry the original name was very vulgar I had to change it a little)
  - Replaced **DJ Hooh Tenan x Ente Kadang Kadang** with the original remixer, **Mirza Mohamad**
  - Replaced **DJ Pak Wong Vong** reupload with the one from **DJ Hengky**
  - Added **DJ Rungkad** by **Dhea Angela** without removing the sped up version.
  - Replaced **DJ Israel Babi** into an extended one. Thank you, **Unknown** on YT.
  - Replaced **DJ Perawan Desa** with the [hopefully] original one.
  - Replaced **DJ Domba Kuring** with another reuploaded one. Let's just hope this one holds.
  - Replaced **DJ Realme** with a full version one where **Ikky Pahlevii** remixes other ringtones too

  #### More submissions
  - **Added DJ Jujur Sa Su Bilang** by **༒•MAYKEL MANTOW•༒** (no im not joking thats his youtube username)
  - **Added DJ Wheels On The Bus Cocomelon** by **DJ Tebang** (submission by me) ((this was so far the worst joke submission ever made))
  - **Added DJ I Just Can't** by **Kevin Rater** (submission by **@fardan.**)
  - **Added DJ As If It's Your Last** by **Nopal Kiky** (submission by **@truejune.**)
